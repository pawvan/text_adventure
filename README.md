## Description

**Text-Based Adventure Game** is a simple, interactive game implemented in OCaml, where players explore a virtual world through a series of rooms. Each room features a unique description and provides various exits that lead to other rooms. Players can navigate by typing commands, such as `go <direction>`, to move between rooms and uncover the story.

The game focuses on state management, allowing players to keep track of their current location and available exits. It serves as an engaging way to learn OCaml programming concepts like pattern matching, recursion, and user input handling.

With potential for expansion, players can easily modify the game by adding new rooms, items, and interactions, making it a fun project for both beginners and experienced OCaml enthusiasts.
